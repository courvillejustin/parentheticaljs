# parentheticaljs

Inspired by an interviewcake problem.

The purpose of parenthetical.js is to take a string, find start and end characters, and record the positions and the inner content.

Example usage,

```javascript
var testString = "((Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this (and this))) they get confusing.))";
console.log(pMap(testString));
```
